CTCI medium #2
Given two lines, each defined by a pair of points, determine their point of intersection, if any.

Main considerations are around:
- Vertical lines
- Parallel lines
- Vertical parallel lines
- Epsilons

we're dealing with floats here, so we gotta be careful about epsilons.

Given a pair of points $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$
the slope is
$frac_{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}$
the first issue comes when $|x_1-x_2| < epsilon$, because that means the slope
is infinite. In this case, we're going to need to set some sort of boolean,
is_vertical=True. Or we could just say `slope=None`, and then make some sort of
convenience method which checks if that is true, call it `is_vertical()`.
If the line is vertical then there is no y-intercept, unless the line is literally the y-axis,
in which case it intersects infinitely many times. But that doesn't matter: if the line is vertical then
all we care about is the x_intercept.
So rather than simply calling it `b`, we will call it `y_or_x_intercept`, and it will be clear to any
logical thinker that the true nature of that variable will be based on the value of `is_vertical`
if you have two equations:
$y = m_1 * x + b_1$
$y = m_2 * x + b_2$
the way you would find the point of intersection is to first set
$m_1 * x + b_1 = m_2 * x + b_2$
and solve for x
then plug either one of them back in to find `y`
