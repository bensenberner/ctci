"""
Given a list of words, find the longest word made of other words
-------

Let's say that there are n words and each one is on average m letters long.
I want to go through each one and see whether it is composed of another word.
I want to go through each word in the list. For each word, I immediately want to see if any other word is the prefix
of this word. If it is, then I want to see if the suffix of that word (as in, the current word without the prefix
that is a different word) itself contains a prefix that is another word.
I'll keep track how many letters are in my current traversal and will keep track of the max. Every time I hit a leaf
node within the trie, that's another potential word; I don't need to go all the way to the bottom.

TODO: what if there are overlapping prefixes??

If I added them all to a trie, that would take O(mn) time.
If I added them all to a set, that would also take O(mn) time.
