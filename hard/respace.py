"""
Given a string containing no spaces, just a series of characters, and a set of words, find a way to unconcatenate the
input string such that it is composed of words from the dictionary and the number of "unrecognized" characters (that
don't show up in the dictionary) are minimized
------------------
Approach 1:
Recursive algorithm with memoization.
Start at the beginning of the string. Check to see if the beginning of the string is in the dictionary. If it isn't,
then "extra_characters" = number of characters in the beginning of the string. Then call the algorithm on the rest of
the string. Keep track of how many characters it ultimately doesn't account for, and return a tuple of both of them,
the best string and the number of unaccounted for characters in that string.

Runtime: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(n) calls in the call stack...O(n^2)
